The sort is not guaranteed to be stable: equal elements may be reversed from their original order. For a stable sort, use SliceStable. The less function must satisfy the same requirements as the Interface type's Less method." />

Every event sent to the channels contains a complete set of instances known to the Instancer. That complete set is sent immediately upon registering the channel, and on any future updates from discovery system." />

If any consumer is alive in a machine room, the message queue of the broker which is deployed in the same machine should only be allocated to those. Otherwise, those message queues can be shared along all consumers since there are no alive consumer to monopolize them.

It routes messages to the correct broker for the provided topic-partition, refreshing metadata as appropriate, and parses responses for errors. You must read from the Errors() channel or the producer will deadlock. You must call Close() or AsyncClose() on a producer to avoid leaks and message lost: it will not be garbage-collected automatically when it passes out of scope and buffered messages may not be flushed." />

      <item value="Maps the interface{} value based on its immediate type from reflect.TypeOf. Map(interface{}) TypeMapper Maps the interface{} value based on the pointer of an Interface provided. This is really only useful for mapping a value as an interface, as interfaces cannot at this time be referenced directly without a pointer. MapTo(interface{}, interface{}) TypeMapper Provides a possibility to directly insert a mapping based on type and value. This makes it possible to directly map type arguments not possible to instantiate with reflect like unidirectional channels. Set(reflect.Type, reflect.Value) TypeMapper Returns the Value that is mapped to the current type. Returns a zeroed Value if the Type has not been mapped." />
