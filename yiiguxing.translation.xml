      <item value="The above introduced way works for slices with any comparable element types. It certainly could be used to compare byte slices (which lengths are equal and known at coding time). Meanwhile, there are two other ways to compare byte slices `x` and `y`, even if the lengths of the two byte slices are not known at compile time." />

      <item value="In Go, slices are incomparable. But if the elements of two slices are comparable, then there is a way to compare the two slices (since Go version 1.17). Assume the elements of the two slices are identical and their lengths are equal and known at coding time, then we could use the following way to compare the two slices." />

With time I've added other utilities for structs. It's basically a high level package based on primitives from the reflect package. Feel free to add new functions or improve the existing code." />

Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions. The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type string or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using context. Users of WithValue should define their own types for keys. To avoid allocating when assigning to an interface{}, context keys often have concrete type struct{}. Alternatively, exported context key variables' static type should be a pointer or interface." />

      <item value="The append built-in function appends elements to the end of a slice. If it has sufficient capacity, the destination is resliced to accommodate the new elements. If it does not, a new underlying array will be allocated. Append returns the updated slice. It is therefore necessary to store the result of append, often in the variable holding the slice itself: slice = append(slice, elem1, elem2) slice = append(slice, anotherSlice...) As a special case, it is legal to append a string to a byte slice, like this:" />
