      <item value="WithValue returns a copy of parent in which the value associated with key is val. Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions. The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type string or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using context. Users of WithValue should define their own types for keys. To avoid allocating when assigning to an interface{}, context keys often have concrete type struct{}. Alternatively, exported context key variables' static type should be a pointer or interface." />

      <item value="The append built-in function appends elements to the end of a slice. If it has sufficient capacity, the destination is resliced to accommodate the new elements. If it does not, a new underlying array will be allocated. Append returns the updated slice. It is therefore necessary to store the result of append, often in the variable holding the slice itself: slice = append(slice, elem1, elem2) slice = append(slice, anotherSlice...) As a special case, it is legal to append a string to a byte slice, like this:" />

      <item value="The following forms are permitted: -flag -flag=x -flag x non-boolean flags only One or two minus signs may be used; they are equivalent. The last form is not permitted for boolean flags because the meaning of the command cmd -x where is a Unix shell wildcard, will change if there is a file called 0, false, etc. You must use the -flag=false form to turn off a boolean flag. Flag parsing stops just before the first non-flag argument (&quot;-&quot; is a non-flag argument) or after the terminator &quot;--&quot;. Integer flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative. Boolean flags may be: 1, 0, t, f, T, F, true, false, TRUE, FALSE, True, False Duration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration. The default set of command-line flags is controlled by top-level functions. The FlagSet type allows one to define independent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands in a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are analogous to the top-level functions for the command-line flag set." />
      <item value="Define flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc. This declares an integer flag, -n, stored in the pointer nFlag, with type int: import &quot;flag&quot; var nFlag = flag.Int(&quot;n&quot;, 1234, &quot;help message for flag n&quot;) If you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions. var flagvar int func init() { flag.IntVar(&amp;flagvar, &quot;flagname&quot;, 1234, &quot;help message for flagname&quot;) } Or you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with pointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by flag.Var(&amp;flagVal, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;help message for flagname&quot;) For such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable. After all flags are defined, call flag.Parse() to parse the command line into the defined flags. Flags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves, they are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values. fmt.Println(&quot;ip has value &quot;, ip) fmt.Println(&quot;flagvar has value &quot;, flagvar) After parsing, the arguments following the flags are available as the slice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i). The arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1. Command line flag syntax" />

      <item value="sigNoteSetup initializes an async-signal-safe note. The current implementation of notes on Darwin is not async-signal-safe, because the functions pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_cond_signal, and pthread_mutex_unlock, called by semawakeup, are not async-signal-safe. There is only one case where we need to wake up a note from a signal handler: the sigsend function. The signal handler code does not require all the features of notes: it does not need to do a timed wait. This is a separate implementation of notes, based on a pipe, that does not support timed waits but is async-signal-safe." />
