Allow the user to easily control what levels are logged 4. Provide an easy mechanism (like fmt.Println) to print info to the user which can be easily logged as well 5. Due to 2 &amp; 3 provide easy verbose mode for output and logs 6. Not have any unnecessary initialization cruft. Just use it." />

      <item value="Seamless printing to the terminal (stdout) and logging to a io.Writer (file) that’s as easy to use as fmt.Println. ![and_that__s_why_you_always_leave_a_note_by_jonnyetc-d57q7um](https:cloud.githubusercontent.comassets17341211002937ccd01654-847d-11e5-828e-12ebaf582eaf.jpg) Graphic by [JonnyEtc](http:jonnyetc.deviantart.comartAnd-That-s-Why-You-Always-Leave-a-Note-315311422) JWW is primarily a wrapper around the excellent standard log library. It provides a few advantages over using the standard log library alone. 1. Ready to go out of the box. 2. One library for both printing to the terminal and logging (to files). 3. Really easy to log to either a temp file or a file you specify." />

Registrar implementations exist for various service discovery systems. Note that identifying instance information (e.g. host:port) must be given via the concrete constructor; this interface merely signals lifecycle changes." />
