      <item value="A heap is a common way to implement a priority queue. To build a priority queue, implement the Heap interface with the (negative) priority as the ordering for the Less method, so Push adds items while Pop removes the highest-priority item from the queue. The Examples include such an implementation; the file example_pq_test.go has the complete source." />
      <item value="A Ring is an element of a circular list, or ring. Rings do not have a beginning or end; a pointer to any ring element serves as reference to the entire ring. Empty rings are represented as nil Ring pointers. The zero value for a Ring is a one-element ring with a nil Value." />

      <item value="As `NaN` values are not equal to each other, it is always a vain to loop up an entry from a map by using a `NaN` key, which could be proved from the following code." />
      <item value="Every two `+Inf` (or `-Inf`) values are equal to each other, but every two `NaN` values are not equal." />
      <item value="In floating-point computations, there are some cases in which the computation results might be infinities (Inf) or not-a-number (NaN). For example, in the following code, a `+Inf` and a `NaN` values are produced (yes, an `Inf` value times zero results a `NaN` value)." />

      <item value="But please note that, as shown in a previous section, if a struct type contains a `_` field of an incomparable type, then the struct type is also incomparable." />

      <item value="Struct values are compared field by field Similarly, when comparing two struct values, their fields will be compared one by one. Once two corresponding fields are found unequal, the whole comparison stops and a false result is resulted. The whole comparison might also stop for a panic produced in comparing two interfaces. For example, the first comparison in the following code results false, but the second one causes a panic." />

      <item value="Lest the `_` fields waste memory, their types should be zero-size types. For example, the size of the type `Ty` is smaller than the type `Tx` in the following code." />

      <item value="Comparing two interface values produces a panic if the dynamic type of the two operands are identical and the identical type is an incomparable type" />
      <item value="Go 1.18 introduces custom generics, so there might be a `slices.Compare` function in future Go versions to compare slices with any comparable element types." />
      <item value="The two ways have no requirements on the lengths of the two operand byte slices." />
      <item value="The second way: `string(x) == string(y)`. Due to an optimization made by the official standard Go compiler, no underlying bytes will be duplicated in this way. In fact, the `bytes.Equal` function uses this way to do the comparison." />

      <item value="FormatInt returns the string representation of i in the given base, for 2 &lt;= base &lt;= 36. The result uses the lower-case letters 'a' to 'z' for digit values &gt;= 10." />
      <item value="The above introduced way works for slices with any comparable element types. It certainly could be used to compare byte slices (which lengths are equal and known at coding time). Meanwhile, there are two other ways to compare byte slices `x` and `y`, even if the lengths of the two byte slices are not known at compile time." />
